Vehicle detection and classification system can be used in the following applications:  
  1. Transportation planning for traffic operation and pavement design (Avely et al., 2004). Differences in size, weight, and performance between light and heavy vehicle need to be considered during transportation planning.  
  2. Vehiclesâ€™ data collection for safety evaluation purposes. Studies show high percentages of fatal accidents involved heavy vehicles (Avely et al., 2004).  
  3. Road maintenance planning. Road wear is affected by weight of the vehicles and traffic flows (Hjort et al., 2008). Road with high traffic of heavy vehicles need to be maintained more frequently.    
  4. Traffic management. Traffic congestion can be managed by allowing only light vehicles to travel on a particular road during peak hours.

    Classification is naturally more challenging if there are multiple targets of various types (e.g., tanks, jeeps, other types of military vehicles, civilian vehicles, etc.). Furthermore, there may be a number of vehicles of the same type, e.g., tanks of a particular make. We define as classification the problem of identifying which class a vehicle belongs to. Identifying a particular vehicle goes one step further and is not within the scope of the current paper.
